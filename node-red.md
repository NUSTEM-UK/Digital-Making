# Node-RED and the Information Superhighway
## What is Node-Red?
Node-RED is a visual tool for gluing together the Internet of Things (IoT). It provides _some_ simplicity when wiring up different web-enabled technologies and software.  
Want your Twitter feed to control your bedroom lamp? Or you FitBit to switch off the power to your fridge when you've not done enough steps? Or to enable audience members to particpate in live data collection in one of your activities? Node-RED is a tool (not the only tool) that can hep you achieve your wildest IoT dreams.  
## Accessing Node-Red
General Node-RED guidance is to fresh install the latest version onto your Pi, rather than just using the version included with Raspbian.
