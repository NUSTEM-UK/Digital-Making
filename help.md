## Micro:Bit links
Lots of Micro:Bit documentation was developed early in the project, when there were about nineteen different programming platforms. As a result, it's still quite hard to find material that's actually useful. In particular, if you find resources for the 'Touch Develop' platform... yeah, that's not a good avenue to go down now.

The best link we've found is:

* [Micro:Bit Make Code documentation](https://makecode.microbit.org/docs)

...which has an excellent set of reference notes for all the blocks in the current web editor, along with example projects.

* [Micro:Bit MicroPython documentation](https://microbit.org/guide/python/)

## Raspberry Pi links

* [Raspberry Pi Foundation Projects (Code Club resource)](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects). This is a terrific set of resources, though it's not always obvious what you're going to get until you've waded into it.

* One of the trickiest bits of digital making on a Pi is working out which pin is which. The `pinout` command at the terminal now prints you a handy little crib sheet. Oh, happy day.

* You can find out what different HATs and boards use by visiting [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz). NOte that
