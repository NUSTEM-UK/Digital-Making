## Micro:Bit links
Lots of Micro:Bit documentation was developed early in the project, when there were about nineteen different programming platforms. As a result, it's still quite hard to find material that's actually useful. In particular, if you find resources for the 'Touch Develop' platform... yeah, that's not a good avenue to go down now.

The best link we've found is:

* [Micro:Bit Make Code documentation](https://makecode.microbit.org/docs)

...which has an excellent set of reference notes for all the blocks in the current web editor, along with example projects.
