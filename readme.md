# Digital Making for Science Communicators

Being a series of notes of questionable consequence, intended to help the newcomer navigate the maze which is digital making.

These notes were originally compiled to assist the 'Digital Making' Skills Day organised by BIG, the UK networking group for science communicators, and delivered by NUSTEM at Northumbria University in 2017. In 2019 a revised version of the day was developed for staff from [Dynamic Earth](https://www.dynamicearth.co.uk), Edinburgh, with participants also from the [Centre for Life](https://www.life.org.uk), Newcastle.

## What there is and where to find it

The 2019 training day for Dynamic Earth day was structured around [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org). Key elements of the day:

* [Traffic Lights](docs/Digital%20Making%20-%20Traffic%20Lights.pdf) example (PDF worksheet)
* Worksheets (all PDFs):
  * [Button / Camera / Twitter](docs/button-camera-twitter.pdf)
  * [Electricity Generation API](docs/elecgenapi.pdf)
  * [EnviroPHAT to Unicorn HAT HD](docs/envirocorn.pdf)
  * [Motors / Lights / Buttons](docs/motors-lights-buttons.pdf)
  * [People in Space API and GUIzero](docs/peopleinspace.pdf)
  * [PyGame Zero](docs/pgzero.pdf)
  * [Analogue Inputs, servos, NeoPixels](docs/pot-input.pdf)
  * [Toggle inputs and Blinkt! HAT](docs/toggle-lights.pdf)
  * [Weather API and ScrollPHAT](docs/weatherapi.pdf)
* Presentations (PDFs):
  * [The day's main structure](docs/presentations/presentation.pdf)
  * [Joe & Jonathan's Journey](docs/presentations/our_story.pdf) (note that videos aren't embedded in the  )

Worksheet code directories are in `/examples`. API keys, Twitter credentials and so on are omitted from this (public) repository.

Source files for the documentation are as follows:

* Worksheets: InDesign files in `/docs/Worksheets (InDesign Files)`
* Presentations: Markdown documents in `/docs/presentations/` (parsed using [DeckSet](https://www.deckset.com), via the included `.dstheme`).

## Legacy documents

For earlier incarnations of this training day we started to write up some more general thoughts and ideas, along with notes on specific platforms including Micro:Bit and Node-RED. These haven't been updated in some time, but may form the basis for future activities and hence remain in place: 

* [Micro:Bit](microbit.md)
* [Node-RED](node-red.md) and the outside world
* [Things to explore](explore.md) (refers to example exercises now superseded by those listed above)
* [Ideas - Principles from which to build](ideas-principles.md) (stub)
* [Ideas - Digital Making](ideas-digital_making.md) (stub, some covered in the newer worksheets, above)
* [Ideas - Programming](ideas-programming.md) (stub, some covered in the newer worksheets, above)
* [Where to look for help](help.md) (stub)
